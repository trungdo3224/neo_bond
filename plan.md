# AI Companion Project Plan

## **🔷 Project Overview**
An AI-powered **companion system** designed to enhance user interaction by recognizing emotions, processing speech, and generating conversations based on mood. The AI will integrate with the **Mood Map Movies app**, potentially expanding into a broader **AI ecosystem** for entertainment and well-being.

## **🎯 Core Features**

### **1. Emotion Recognition (Computer Vision & Speech Processing)**
- Detect **facial expressions** and adjust responses accordingly.
- Analyze **voice tone** to determine emotional state.

### **2. Conversational AI**
- Generate text based on user **emotions and past interactions**.
- Multi-agent system where different AI instances have **unique personalities and expertise**.
- **Memory retention** for contextual, personalized conversations.

### **3. Multi-Agent Collaboration**
- Different AI instances can **brainstorm together** to offer more insightful interactions.
- Each AI instance specializes in **different skills** (e.g., movies, psychology, productivity).

### **4. Speech Processing**
- Accept **voice input** for a more **natural interaction experience**.
- Convert speech to text for **context-aware responses**.

### **5. Mood Map Movies Integration**
- **Analyze user mood** and recommend movies accordingly.
- Engage in **discussions about movie choices**.
- Learn from user feedback to **refine future recommendations**.

## **🔷 User Interaction Model**

### **🛠 Default Interaction Behavior**
- **Passive Mode:** AI **waits** for user engagement.
- **Check-ins:** 1-2 light check-ins per day.
- **Adaptive Learning:** AI adjusts frequency based on user preferences.

### **🎭 Emotion-Based Interaction Adjustments**
| Emotion         | AI Behavior |
|----------------|------------|
| 😊 Happy      | Engages more, suggests fun activities, playful banter. |
| 😞 Sad        | Offers support, comforting content, and gentle check-ins. |
| 😠 Angry      | Minimizes interruptions, offers venting space or calming activities. |
| 🤔 Confused   | Guides with structured responses, clarifies doubts. |
| 😐 Neutral    | Stays in background mode, responds when needed. |
| 😲 Surprised  | Engages with curiosity, matches energy level. |

### **⏳ Time-Based Interaction**
- **Morning:** Greetings, motivation, daily recommendations.
- **Afternoon:** Energy boost, activity suggestions.
- **Evening:** Wind-down recommendations, reflections on the day.
- **Late Night:** Minimal interaction unless initiated.

### **⚙️ Adaptive Learning & Personalization**
- Tracks user response patterns.
- Learns preferred interaction frequency.
- **Optional Modes:** Silent, Balanced, Engaged.
