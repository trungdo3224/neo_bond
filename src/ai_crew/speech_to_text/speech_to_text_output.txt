The creeping silence.  Not the comfortable quiet of a peaceful night, but a silence that feels wrong, unnatural.  A silence so profound that it presses in on you, a physical weight in your chest.  It's a silence that holds its breath, waiting.  Waiting for *something* to break it, something that will be far worse than the silence itself.  And you know, with a certainty that chills you to the bone, that it's waiting for *you*.
